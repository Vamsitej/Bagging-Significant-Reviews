      "1-more flexible2-bass is very high3-sound clarity is good 4-battery back up to 6 to 8 hour's 5-main thing is fastest charging system is available in that. Only 20 min charge and get long up to 4 hours back up 6-killing look awesome 7-for gaming that product does not support 100% if you want for gaming then I'll recommend you please don't buy but you want for only music then this product is very well for you.. 8-no more wireless headphones are comparing with that headphones at this price this is fabulous headphones for music lover\n",
      "Super sound and good looking I like that prize\n",
      "Very much satisfied with the device at this price point being from an awesome brand. Design wise , I liked it more than rockerz 255 model.Bought the model blindly on its very first day with zero reviews and it was a wonderful choice I must say.Bluetooth 5.0 enables us to connect devices simultaneously. And vibration motor for calls , its too good.\n",
      "Nice headphone, bass was very good and sound is clear. I am purchase for calling purpose and best choice even riding on bike wear in one ear and opposite end voice was clear and no complaint for calling.. Battery backup 1 full day\n",
      "Sound quality super battery backup super quality super this price range super and this value for money\n",
      "Wowwww it's amezing bluetooth nice look, nice price, nice battery back up, I love always flipkart product's and Flipkart replacement and refund policy, you can return or refund after received a demegzed product\n",
      "Awesome colour! Amazing experience .. but only the charging data cable is not of good quality and adjustable clip is not so tight.\n",
      "For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedbackBass : 10/10Clarity : 9/10Comfort ease n looks : 15/10Features :10/10The best buy from flipkart yet..\n",
      "First of all the Delivery boy is a good guy. Nice receive and responce. Product is super. Packing also good.  I fell Red color is not sufficient for me. Otherwise totally awesome product. Delivery is too long. Iam taking one week after booking. Thankyou flipcart and boat 235v2 also.\n",
      "This headphone is good but not that much as i expected*Pros- 1Good battery backup             2Good sound quality*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointedOverall not goodDon't buy please\n",
      "It's a very good product ... I'm so happy with this BCz its bass quality & sounds is too good & batry back up Also super\n",
      "Nice build quality.. bass is best it self.. vibrate at call is nice. .. nice support from flipkart and delivery partner\n",
      "After using for about 8 days, right side of the earphone is not working properly and the volume on right side is  very low. I didn't expect this.\n",
      "Mic is not proper recipient persons can't hear proper sound ( every time for call I heard from front I can't hear you so I have to again talk to through Mobile phone no Option useless of wirless meaning)  and sound quality is so loud. Like local headphones. not comfortable to wear for more than1 hrs of uses.tere is no meanings to get replaced again you get same product therefore this is wast of money.\n",
      "Wow flip cart super fast service like  express speed delivery I order 11 am delivery At 5pm I am very happy,  boAt Bluetooth headset is very very excellent product fast charging super totally user friendly go for it\n",
      "Very great product at this price I will assure that this is a value for money product and the bass and sound quality was awesome the build quality was great 👌 and this product has a mat finish which gives a class and flagship look this is the best and the fast charging technology was working very well and the ear are fixing suitable in our ear the music quality was great\n",
      "It's very good and its bass is very high This bluetooth is very good best value or money but battery is too tiny.....Battery backup is not long time but it's realy fast charging support so little battery is comfortable with fast charging\n",
      "Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving. Wanted to give 5star but there is a sentence that \" Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world\" 😄😄😉\n",
      "This review is after 1 month of use .Pro:- 1.Battery backup is genuinely too good, runs almost 1.5 -2 days on a single charge.. and 8hrs on continuous playback.2. Charge very fast,,, 40% just in 15-20 minutes3. Sound is crisp,clear and decent, not too loud.  4. Build quality is awsome nd stylish as well.5.connectivity is super fast nd good with phones.6. Last but not the least,,, its really comfort able nd i didn't feel any discomfort or pain even after continous use of 5 hrs which i faced in many other earphones.Cons: Sometimes disconnected from my laptop in the middle nd connects again.\n",
      "I like It Boat HP Sound Quality is bestm best And Bass Quality is to good And New V2 product is to good & Fast charging is besttt to save charging  timeing....\n",
      "Hi Seekers, I am writing this review after 2 weeks of daily use, lets start with pros and cons Pros-✓Sounds Quality is good✓ Bass is good enough✓ Look is okay as per this price range ✓ All essential controls are provided✓ Backup is decentConsxx Bluetooth range is too short (even if you are walking by holding phone in your hand you will feel connection disturbances at all times)xx In case of battery get low it continuously gives you a voice signals in every 2 seconds I found its very annoyingxx Build quality is below averagexx You cannot feel premiumness at all hereFinal comment- If your purpose is using Bluetooth earphones while walking or jogging it's NOT recommend BUT if you don't move too much(normal movement is just fine) then go for it it's over all a good deal undoubtedly.Hope this helps !\n",
      "Great product.. I loved it.. As I was using level U.. This product is much more better than that.. Though battery life is just like 8hrs and bass like goosebumps... But when increased bass earplugs starts raddling.. Vibrate feature is awesome..\n",
      "Awesome product happy to have one.Good sound quality in medium volume, with equalizer app could complete the high bass sound. Battery last long 20 min of charge to enjoy whole day.Very light weight, Easy to carry,\n",
      "It's a very good product... I'm so happy with this Bcz it's bass quality & sounds is too good & battery backup also superb\n",
      "Amazing product   Sound quality was awesome, it has deep bass which I really wanted, I am really satisfied and battery backup was also nice and it also had fast charging facilities\n",
      "I think it is the best product in this price segment I buy this product after seeing it's sell figure and my decision got right u must buy this product I love it's sound quality but the build quality must be improved and they must give charging adaptor out of the box\n",
      "Best product at this price loved it. Thank you flipkart for safe delivery 💯😃\n",
      "Excellent voice clarity superb bass for music lovers. Overall a very good product.\n",
      "This earphone is just awsome yaar , everything is just so perfect yaar just go for it blindly ,i tell you u cant find a best product at this price its awsome👌👌👌👌\n",
      "It is an amazing product.. For this price... Less weight.. Flexible.. Super sound... Extra feature is call vibration.. Nice one.. Try it..\n",
      "The product was good enough.. Stylish blur color with well designed earphones.. Coming to the specifications sound and bass was superb... Value for money... Batery backup is also good around 6 hours life.... No lag in PUBG... Highly satisfied but have to wait and see how long it works like this\n",
      "Boat headset is very clear voice and bass is v good and plus point is fast charging 20 mint to 4 hrs batery backup... One of the best bluetooth headset....osmmm products\n",
      "A fine product i would say , well crafted design and good build quality ..  good fit and comfortable to wear ... enough bass to provide u good sound experience .. although not the most premium quality but still considering the price it's well ahead of it .. manages lows and highs well, sound mixing and good listening experience when it comes to music video and others ..the only CON i noticed was the microphone .. i think this device is not built for calling ... sometimes the voice is not even audible to others on call ... it's really annoying. my experience of calling on this device is not a very good one. person on another end always used to complaint regarding the low volume or even not audible at all ... a little issue with mic .. apart from this, it's agood deal to grab\n",
      "Good product very fast delivery (with in 36 hours only) superb color love it\n",
      "Boat rockerz 235 v2 is the budget blutooth hearphone. All are very good performance only sound quality is slightly poor.. vibration and battery backup is the best part in this product. Bass also very great .. just lysric clearing not proper\n",
      "If you are a bass lover then blindly go for it . And I think 8 hours of backup is enough and 4 hours charge in 20 mins .what else we want . Superb\n",
      "Review after about 2months of usage.Before starting let me be clear, THIS DEVICE IS NOT FOR SERIOUS MUSIC LOVERS/AUDIOPHILES.I'm not gonna repeat the same technical aspects of it, you already know what's inside it. So...Coming to the sound, if you just love some BASS and heavy sounds this earphone will become your best buddy in no time. The volume on this is insane. I only use it at 20-30% max. It's very loud. So no complaints there.If you've used some premium earphone from brands like JBL, Sennheisser or even Samsung buds+ (even in the  Rs.5-10k range), you'll notice their sound, instruments separations etc., is more superior than this one from Boat. You can clearly make out the difference in the sounds produced, even the heavy BASS in BOAT feels too much artificial compared to them.So, if you're looking for pure music enjoyment, then go for some other earphones.BUT, if you just want that punchy bass your looking for and you're on a tight budget, then this is the one for you! Call quality is ok, in closed environment (room, office) it gets the job done. But in the open, not so much. There's a lot of disturbance and it picks up every noise in the open environment (traffic etc).Connectivity: No problems here. It pairs quite easily, and can go up to 22-27 feet with no drop in connection. Even when there's a wall the connection was solid.Built quality: Not much quality, considering price point, it's OK. Wires are very thin and the plastic looks cheap. But again for Rs. 899/- I'm fine with it.Conclusion: Sound quality: 7/10Bass : 9/10 (but it feels artificial when you compare to others like jbl, Sennheisser, Samsung)Built quality: 7/10Battery backup: 9/10 (easily can get 8-10hrs non stop)Call quality: 7/10Connectivity: 8.5/10\n",
      "Im a jbl user ..boat 235v2 battery is too good to stay 2 days..fast charging..bass is 5 of 5 but sound of vocal is 4 of 5.. mic is good ..although i bought this in 1299 ..in this range its good\n",
      "The boat 235v2 is really good it's sounds very clear and also good bass. If you think buy a Bluetooth headset go for It. Just sounds and battery backup is awesome.\n",
      "Above from my expectation, after reading the review i opted for not to purchase this product but guys you won't believe it really work, too good sound quality, superb bass overall it is lovelly one....will make ur day sweet.......bass lover will loved it.This boat 235v2 is better than boult pro bass product coz i ordered both the earphone jst as to compare the quality and boat rockerz is jst uncomaprable...perfect tune...superb acaustic....voice calling is far better that boult earphone.....it will give u clear voice.So guys i would give rating as.....Sound quality of boat 4/5Sound quality of boult 3/5Bass- boat 4.5/5Bass-  boult 2.5/5Voice calling boat 4/5Boult 3/5And boat company also assures you that after charging for 20 min you will get 4 hrs playback...that means a lot to me.......So, no need to think close ur eyes and go for this product cz i assure u that you will gonna love it🤗🤗👍👍👍👍👍\n",

      "It's works fine and superb with this budget. Only thing is it will not compatible for PUBG game you will get the sound later for every action. Ex. You get the enemies foots sound after arrival means later.\n",
      "I bought it for my mom and it's good.....well just good nothing more there are some issues but they can be neglected considering the price so if someone is on a tight budget then this is good or else I will recommend to go for oneplus bullets z earphone they are far better than these.\n",
      "Beat product for normal people for class office work and song streaming ....Sound quality osm : no vibration or cracks with highest volume also...Battery back up good : with morning 100% charge last till night on continues useing ... Experience of 3 months ...Hardware : has been fallen from 4 to 5 feet 3 to 4 times all is fine Vibration : the vibration when we get call the band near the neck vibrates not so harsh so it's goood Best part : connects 2 device at a time which will help easy shifting of phone ... Range : as it is specified to do ... It works.well osm without any crack sound when I lev phone in hall and go to kitchen ... I haven't calculated meters but it's pretty far . So range is good Durability : harsh use , sweat , falling to floor many times , give as catch catch to friends , hidden below piles of books ... Still alive  , so it lives long don't worry ...That's it friends ,, U can buy it heartfully U can buy the next updated version of this rockers 335 because it last for 1 solid week with 1 full charge Harder body then this and range is more better then this (this is also quite well , am not discourageing this by the way ) and bass more more osm then this Cost rupees 1999 U can go for this for a best battery life if 1 day charge is adjustable do but 235 with is quite enf for daily use  Hit a like if u liked my review....Thank you ,Vijay\n",
      "Awesome product. Value for money. Good sound quality with better bass. Best thing is battery backup it last up to 12 to 14 hrs in single charge. Surely suggested......👍\n",
      "Good quality sound output from the earphones. Battery backup is good as per product specification do meets the exact backup time. Reacharge also won't take much time. Only thing I found little bit bad was the thin wires used. If you are a tough user go for flat wired type boat models, this one could break if not used safely and softly. Good product.\n",
      "Good product,  I liked ,decent sound quality, good battery backup. Charging port is not in proper place  it should have been in different place. Call  quality is good. Thanks Flipkart\n",
      "Very good headset with very good sound quality and charging is very fastOnly thing is that the support for ear plugs can be made little bit more comfortableOverall a very good product.\n",
      "Ear buds not comfort to ears.last call memory is there.next song forward is not there.we can't skip present song to go next song.very good blue tooth set for that price.very fast charging.charging cable.is given. charging adopter not given. over-all one should buy this.buy and enjoy .triple sound s are not effective.\n",
      "Using this product since 10 days (as on 03.07.2020)Crystal Clear soundBass is good enoughVery soft earbudsBattery is long lasting battery is too much impressive even I feel no need of wired earphoneVery cool and stylish looktill date no cons.......\n",
      "Super fast charge.sound was good bass also good\n",
      "I have purchased it in 899. After using 3 days I am writing this review.  It has very good battery backup. In 10 min charge you can used it for 2.5 hr. Sound quality is good. It has good bass as well. Previously I was using boat 255 and it has better bass and design as well. The issue in it the connectivity is not much good. If you have put mobile in your pocket then Somtimes you will feel distortion. But if you love balanced music, then it is not for you. Go for others Brand with more 1000 rs.\n",
      "Super and good quality bass price Rs.899 awesome product good thanking you flipkart.\n",
      "Delivered 1 day before. Good packing. Build quality cheap but may last if use with care. Sound ok. Connects to 2 devices. Ear hooks fit properly. Vibrates on call. Voice command works for google. Range very bad. No connection in next room. Ok for this price.After purchase in June left side stopped working in September. They took 6 days to respond to complaint. Product was home collected free. Took 8 days to reach mumbai. Took 7 days for response. Took 9 days to reach me at kolkata with replaced new product. Happy with service. Just not sure if warranty of 1 year is from June or October 2020. Adding new pics of new replaced product.\n",
      "Excellent quality product. Comparing to oriamo bass is little bit less. But battery backup is good, and fast charging also good.  Charging indicator led is not visible. But sometimes i  get distbance while listening music.\n",
      "As per the observation of the product from the purchasing date to till the time .Please don't go for this product its like china product . I brought this on October  and saw it have 1 year warranty .MY headset left side is stopped working within in4 months. As per the advise from flip kart Customer care i reached the showroom with my Bill copy and all They are not ready to do replace or free service. They suggested me to go mobile service center for repaired the same. Really unsatisfied...\n",
      "Bass too good ..but Dolby sound s not clear and left right sound output not here .. this s full base centre sound effects ly .. song left right music 0% .. middle bass middle sound music ...\n",

      "Awesome product in low budget Great Voice quality all feature are good I am strongly recommend to buy this earphone.. Happy\n",
      "It is a good product at this price range... But not recommended for gaming and calling it also don't support 3D sound effect. I will update my review after using few months\n",
      "Really awesome product by boat with stylish design.& Battery backup is just awesome with fast charging technology just go for it guys\n",
      "sound quality is good... expecially the bassthe design is much pretty but its hard to wear in the sleepy times. its mat finish is much impressive nd it also  with the inbuilt mic and battery backup , nd its bass is the main quality.. nd product quality is much better.in this price range its the best option ...its not more flexible ... we cant carry it in the pocket .. but usually its a neckband.. and it suit perfect and work perfect ..and it vibrating when we got a call .  its a good thing but its never stops that vibration untill we cut the call if we put our phone in to silent mode its not stop vibration ... in some situations its not good .. over all its excellent ...just go for it\n",
      "Although it's too early to write a review after just one day of use but I was using skullcandy method for two years but due to support local manufacturer this time I decided to purchase these earphones and believe me it's way more better than any other so called established brands. Sound and Bass are next level cool Bettery back up is also goodVibration during incoming call is a feature which was missing in skullcandy method which was 3200 while it's cost is 864(During sale).\n",
      "It's not too good , When I play any song fast I hear a sound like \"kachh\" sound quality is not good\n",
      "Awesome product bass is tooooo good  battery backup and fast charge good finally music and especially bass lovers must buy this product thank u flipcart very fast deliveryAnd finally Thank u sooo much boat such a amazing product and very low price\n",
      "Sound quality not that good. Can't play it in full volume. Boat rockers 255 is way better than this product. I would definitely not recommend this earphone as if u add some 300rs to this price you can go for boat rockers 255. Avoid buying this, it's not worth ot\n",
      "Nice...This is my first wireless handfree as per expectations Nice one  Design  is good but finishing is rough Bass is not to Good but okey  everg Calling is good i'm HappyDelivery was also Nice before Due date deliveredThanks Flipkart..Overall good purchase in this price range..\n",
      "Best price and value for money.... Bass quality is oswm.... Clear sound and loud sound of full volume.. Design and build quality is superb in this price range Battery backup is oswm.... I used with full charge its run a full day... I am soo happy with battery backup... And vibration mood is superb... ... Don't thik just buy it....\n",
      "Battery backup and build quality is good. Look wise also good. Fitted well in ear. But not happy with sound quality of song. You will need to install seprate equalizer application for better sound .\n",
      "I love it specially because of battery backup.. sound quality is actually good but if you looking at it for calling purpose only so don't buy it. Noise cancelling doesn't work properly in these earphones others wise very nice product for those who love watching movies for hours and play games too\n",
      "Must buy bluetooth headset. Guys blindly go for this headset. Very very worthy. It looks like more premium and got good design. It looks more premium than 255 F model. The most important thing in this headset is adjustable wire strap.\n",
      "Review after 20 days of use.First of all bass is good if you love bass then go for it without second thought.Lags in build department as wires are thin.Have magnetic buds with no functionality i don't know why they provided.Connectivity is good i can hear music from one room to other without much distortion.If you are buying for general use like music and stuff then it's okay but for gamers or i say pubg players then you will be disappointed becoz they are just bad in that department there is about 1-1.5 second lag which is huge in case of pubg specially in close encounters.\n",
      "Good Quality i use this everyday but its design is have to like Samsung's level U product. Otherwise its sound quality is awesome in this price level.\n",
      "Awesome Product... It's a nice Bluetooth Headset, no doubt. It's sound is so sweet and design looks so good. It's battery backup is also very good. But using it for so long, it's bud make ears pain. So, for short time, it's very good product.\n",
      "1. Charging Speed is very fast hardly take 45 minutes.2. Superb smooth bass...enjoying to listening deep bass songs.3. Perfectly placed music keys.\n",
      "I am using this one week. The boat 235v2  performance is excellent. sound quality is good. Bass also very good. Battery life it's comes for two days. Bluetooth is good it paring at a time for two mobiles . It's very nice  head set good for all .totally I  will give 4.5 out of 5\n",
      "Good in this price range but not the bestSound quality is good for the price  , the battery life is great in this price range but in real life The earphones are not so comfortable for your ears , just after 30 mins it's feels uncomfortable in your ear.The built quality is average.Don't go for the boat logoSearch for other options alsoAlso check - MAONO AUD30The sound quality is good but a complete package for 1000 rupees . It fits good the bass is also above average , stylish and the build quality is better than 235v2.\n",
      "Excellent product...  Awesome  sound with very nice bass. connecting to all devices quickly. Call quality is very good. Battery last for very long time.\n",
      "Excellent voice clarity superb bass for music lovers . Good buy at a reasonable price.\n",
      "positives - *good & fast battery *Very good sound quality *Sleek design and colourNegatives- *range is too short. Compny claim 10 mt but it was maximum of 6 mt only. i've tested many times.*If u use in open environment little bit of air disturb ur sound no matter the how near u with ur phone.I give it 3 star because  range is most important to me and full marks om design n battry\n",
      "I am writing this review after using this device for 10 days , here are some of my experiences The sound quality is good but the bass is low The buit of the neck band is of good material but the wires of earphone are very thin The earphones does not perfectly fit in my ear , and falls often Battery backup is very good , approx 8 hours for me in one charge Connectivity is good Call quality is also good , I feel no distubance in talking , even while walking I could finely hear the voices as well the other side can hear my voice clear even when I am talking in low voices Bluetooth connectivity range is a little lower than claimed But in total , I an happy with product , and would be more happy if it perfectly fit in my ear apart from that the product is worth the price .\n",
      "Any bdy likezzz music... just go for it....last time i m used boat rockerz 255f, more than that i like this one... the voice is cristal clear... i feel that in this neck band have enough bass is there.... i f any body likezz bass blindly you can go for it....genuinely sayzz...\"I m full satisfied\"...\n",
      "I got this earphones in 900 and it's best in this price range, in my experience some good things are:- 1.Battery backup is good as mentioned.2. Vibration feature is awesome.3. Build quality is good but not best.4. Fast charging is good .Some cons:- 1. Call swapping not possible or call disconnected during conference call.2. Sound is not crunchy, bass is good but treble is missing.3. Mic issue in each and every earphones sold ,I have tried in 3 different, opp person can't hear my voice properly or low volume.\n",

      "Pros:1.Looks very stylish feels light weight and comfortable for    long usage.2.Vibration feature is very useful. 3.Sound quality is decent with good amount of bass as    compared to price.4.Charges very fast in my case it takes 1 hr to charge from 0-    100%.5. Battery backup is also good I use it in office for calls and     music and keep it connected the whole day yet its battery     gives me 2 days of usage time.Cons:1. Connecting wires feel fragile not for very rough use. 2. No Latency issues during watching movies or YouTube     videos but the latency issue is too much during gaming,     you can't play PUBG using these earphones as the sounds     of firing and footsteps of enemies are heard after 1 to 1.5     seconds.3. Sometimes during watching YouTube videos the audio     starts being distorted and you have to disconnect and     reconnect to solve the issue and it happens regularly     like 3-4 times in a day.Overall Experience:Worth buying @ 999/- everything is good you will enjoy everything while using these neckbands.Not for gaming at all if you're looking for wireless earphones for gaming purpose than you should double your budget and go for oneplus z or oppo enco m31.\n",
      "To be frank it's not up to what i expected.... i have been using boat 900 for last couple of years... May be because it is wired one, the quality of audio is very good in 900.....

Battery backup is also good I use it in office for calls and     music and keep it connected the whole day yet its battery     gives me 2 days of usage time.Cons:1. Connecting wires feel fragile not for very rough use. 2. No Latency issues during watching movies or YouTube     videos but the latency issue is too much during gaming,     you can't play PUBG using these earphones as the sounds     of firing and footsteps of enemies are heard after 1 to 1.5     seconds.3. Sometimes during watching YouTube videos the audio     starts being distorted and you have to disconnect and     reconnect to solve the issue and it happens regularly     like 3-4 times in a day.Overall Experience:Worth buying @ 999/- everything is good you will enjoy everything while using these neckbands.Not for gaming at all if you're looking for wireless earphones for gaming purpose than you should double your budget and go for oneplus z or oppo enco m31.\n",
      "To be frank it's not up to what i expected.... i have been using boat 900 for last couple of years... May be because it is wired one, the quality of audio is very good in 900..... But in this Bluetooth one it's not that great.... But still according to the price it is a good deal. Battery back up is good and the build quality is nice......\n",
      "Good packing and fast delivery light weight good quality at best price\n",
      "It's really nice earphone it's looking good and it's better backup wass asmon it's good l bought it is 900 in that price was no compuition rally nice\n",
      "positives - *good & fast battery *Very good sound quality *Sleek design and colourNegatives- *range is too short. Compny claim 10 mt but it was maximum of 6 mt only. i've tested many times.*If u use in open environment little bit of air disturb ur sound no matter the how near u with ur phone.I give it 3 star because  range is most important to me and full marks om design n battry\n",
      "I am writing this review after using this device for 10 days , here are some of my experiences The sound quality is good but the bass is low The buit of the neck band is of good material but the wires of earphone are very thin The earphones does not perfectly fit in my ear , and falls often Battery backup is very good , approx 8 hours for me in one charge Connectivity is good Call quality is also good , I feel no distubance in talking , even while walking I could finely hear the voices as well the other side can hear my voice clear even when I am talking in low voices Bluetooth connectivity range is a little lower than claimed But in total , I an happy with product , and would be more happy if it perfectly fit in my ear apart from that the product is worth the price .\n",
      "Any bdy likezzz music... just go for it....last time i m used boat rockerz 255f, more than that i like this one... the voice is cristal clear... i feel that in this neck band have enough bass is there.... i f any body likezz bass blindly you can go for it....genuinely sayzz...\"I m full satisfied\"...\n",
      "I got this earphones in 900 and it's best in this price range, in my experience some good things are:- 1.Battery backup is good as mentioned.2. Vibration feature is awesome.3. Build quality is good but not best.4. Fast charging is good .Some cons:- 1. Call swapping not possible or call disconnected during conference call.2. Sound is not crunchy, bass is good but treble is missing.3. Mic issue in each and every earphones sold ,I have tried in 3 different, opp person can't hear my voice properly or low volume.\n",

      "Everything is fine about this product except the wire quality. Its not bad, bt can be improved.Otherwise best if you see price wise\n",
      "Very good for average users who are not looking for deep bass. Battery life is decent and charge time is quick.A few times there is some sort of connection problems and the headset keeps disconnecting and reconnecting, but it happens only once or twice in 2 to 3 days so nothing to worry about.Also while answering calls sometimes though the headset is connected you wont be able to answer and the inbuilt vibrator wont stop even after answering the call through your phone.Nice mids and average highs.Rest all and all a good deal nothing fancy here.\n",
      "Awesome product it is very useful to taking call while on drive and good designed for wire strip come with this is good to see totally worthy to purchase\n",

      "Posting this review after use of one day. The build quality of this product is very good, quality of material is great. Big battery backup as claimed by the company so for build quality n battery backup 5 out of 5. But if we compare sound quality then i qm quite disappointed. My local earphones giving nice sound than this, for me sound quality should have been more better than this, i wanted to return this product but there is no option of cash refund and now have to bear loss for this. I should have gone for wired headphone rather this one. Very disappointed. So those who wants the sound quality, deep bass, clear vocal then do not go for it..\n",
      "Pretty Happy with the Bass and Lowest price range.Actually it is far better than the higher version of rockers itself in the design aspect.also it offers a decent sound quality.Don't compare it with headphones of 2k price range.If you are not happy in spending more than 1k then go for it.It delivers good sound quality in voice calling also,and Mic is decent.It will never disappoint you.\n",
      "best in market..superb quality and very good battery backup,235v2 boat is much better than other boat Bluetooth..sound is superb\n",

      "Pros.1) bass is good 2) design is very good and build quality is also very nice3)ear fiting is really really good4)can connect to 2 devicesCons.1) connectivity is fast but audio lag is there.     A real noticeable gap that can make video different.2) connectivity is fast but sometimes showing connected but doesn't playing audio in earphone.3) treble is low and bass is high so sometimes in some song you will feel need of treble .Conclusion:-A good earphone with very sleek design and build.Nice fit in ear.can be a nice buy.......I bought it for 1099\n",
      "These earphones are really amazing and worth buying. .. only for those who loves playing song , movies or for gym purpose ... Those who wants to buy it for pubg .. i request u not to buy...

      "Microphone of this Bluetooth headset is problematic. When we receive call person talking with us can't hear properly. And tha game is started of hello hello and hello...Faulty headset given by boAt..Replace it now only.\n",
      "I own both the boat rockers 235 and boAt 235v2 and I can say that the sound quality of 235v2 is soft and clear but it lacks the punch that boat rockers 235 has. Morever it is a bit heavier then the boat rockers 235 making it little uncomfortable for a long use. Better Is however exceptionally good. The range is not taht much of a improvement and the most annoying thing I experienced is that it gets disconnected very quick and most of time when I connect it with my laptop will only connect and voice and will take 2-3 tried to connect music. So I think I can finally conclude that the boAt rockers 235 is a better choice for its punch bass and lightweight anyone looking for a cheap bluetooth should definitely consider that and morever it will help with long pubg sessions .\n",
      "So I have been using these for about a month now. The battery backup is good which usually lasts 8 to 9 hours. But you can't actually use once it reaches 20 percent. It starts annoying you with 'battery low' message every 20 seconds or so. They could have set the annoying threshold to 5 percent. And driving on 2 wheelers with these is a nightmare. It flies away if you drive fast even while not using it with the magnetic earbuds connected. Sound and bass is good considering its price (899)There's a noticable latency while playing games\n",
      "Its an awesome product.But if you are going for this to play games then you must not. It gets a sound delay.Overall its sound quality is immersive.Microphone need to be improved. The voice sound gets reduced when in call.\n",

It starts annoying you with 'battery low' message every 20 seconds or so. They could have set the annoying threshold to 5 percent. And driving on 2 wheelers with these is a nightmare. It flies away if you drive fast even while not using it with the magnetic earbuds connected. Sound and bass is good considering its price (899)There's a noticable latency while playing games\n",

So I think I can finally conclude that the boAt rockers 235 is a better choice for its punch bass and lightweight anyone looking for a cheap bluetooth should definitely consider that and morever it will help with long pubg sessions .\n",
      "So I have been using these for about a month now. The battery backup is good which usually lasts 8 to 9 hours. But you can't actually use once it reaches 20 percent. It starts annoying you with 'battery low' message every 20 seconds or so. They could have set the annoying threshold to 5 percent. And driving on 2 wheelers with these is a nightmare. It flies away if you drive fast even while not using it with the magnetic earbuds connected. Sound and bass is good considering its price (899)There's a noticable latency while playing games\n",
      "Its an awesome product.But if you are going for this to play games then you must not. It gets a sound delay.Overall its sound quality is immersive.Microphone need to be improved. The voice sound gets reduced when in call.\n",
      "Sound quality is seriously lacking.Don't buy if you want a poor sound experience.I did the same mistake, and didn't listen to the reviewers\n",
      "Disconnect some times automatically,And also connectivity issues\n",
      "After 6 months of usage, I got connectivity problem and claimed for warranty, I got message from boat that they will replace with new one, after 10 days I got new product, but the product quality is completely looks different like local quality products. I suggest most of my friends to go for boat as trusted brand, worst service from boat,  don't go for it guys, After one year surely you will face connectivity problems in bluetooth, headset etc. This is my 5th boat products and all the products I have got same issue.\n",

      "Initially its impressive... Boat signature sound.. Okish build quality... Connect with multiple smartphones... Good battery backup getting 12+ hours easily with medium volume... Light and comfortable without ear fins...Cons - the earfins cause pain after 15 min of usage... There is no option to switch between two devices.. Wire is slightly on thinner side...my primary earphone is boat bass headphone 103 - wire quality is similar - i am using 103 for more than 1.5 years still working fine.. So assuming that wire of 235 v2 also should last long... It plays only one audio at a time eg.

Control buttons are also moved to left side as compared to Boat Rockerzz 255. Rockerzz 255 had on right side. I think its ok, but it takes some time to be in habit.3. Could not return/replace it as 7 days time was very less, I did not use it for mic in first few days and hence did not get to know.

Its irritating and not at all recommended during important calls. Not sure if only my piece is damaged or the product itself is a failure.2. Control buttons are also moved to left side as compared to Boat Rockerzz 255. Rockerzz 255 had on right side. I think its ok, but it takes some time to be in habit.3. Could not return/replace it as 7 days time was very less, I did not use it for mic in first few days and hence did not get to know. I tried to replace it on 8th day, but flipkart did not allow that due to bad policy.4. Sound quality is ok, but sounds artificial at times.\n",

It has 5.0 bluetooth connectivity..even when playing PUBG, it is the closest to real time audio production in comparison to other bluetooth headsets in similar range. Color is good, finish is good.What's not good is the wire quality,  the wire that goes from neckband to earbuds seems very fragile. It is the only thing that i feel like need a bit care while handling.  But that remains an issue till you put it on. Also, it remains in the ears. Don't slip occassionally. I don't put them deep in my ears. I like it this way only. And they are serving the purpose well and good. This is what i thought should share with you all in case you are considering it.\n",

After Bluetooth connection is established, the audio from phone/laptop starts coming from earphones, but then it pauses it just to say \"you are now connected to rockerz so and so\"! Very very irritating. Same thing happens with \"oops battery low\" indication which comes every 5 seconds. 3 stars reduced for this irritating feature alone. Other than this I found the bass to be increased which I don't like. Earpieces create a vacuum in the ear which is uncomfortable. Rest is all good.\n",

Very very irritating. Same thing happens with \"oops battery low\" indication which comes every 5 seconds. 3 stars reduced for this irritating feature alone. Other than this I found the bass to be increased which I don't like. Earpieces create a vacuum in the ear which is uncomfortable. Rest is all good.\n",

Other than this I found the bass to be increased which I don't like. Earpieces create a vacuum in the ear which is uncomfortable. Rest is all good.\n",

Sound quality is more than good, will exceed the expectations, though it didn't satisfy my expectations for I am a music enthusiasts and listen through Dolby Atmos but still its way much better than any other product at this price range in the market. Battery backup will be 7-8 hours  constant, period. But the only issue i have is built quality which for me is average, it will hurt your ear after a long period of use-time, which for me is a downside, disappointed i might say quietly.

      "Here, yeah I bought it before a week and just used it it was amazing! It is fully light weight and flexible i just attached the photo of flexible. It comes with 1 year warranty card, charging cable without adapter, two sets of extra bud, user manual. And the features are call alert first vibration and then ringtone  there was no delay in sound, LED indicator blue and red, water proof, magnetic ear trips. Charging time it was absolutely 💯 true 20min charge = 3-4 hours. Though I didn't charge fully yet so far. But it varies the play back hours when u kept in full sound it discharged less than 6 hours. If u keep it in 13 out of 15 volume level it surely give more than 8 hours play back charge. I hope that! it'll use full to u.\n",

      "Best headset in all ascepts I bought at 800 Wroth for that price Good headset\n",
      "Writing this review after 2 days of usage:- Pros:-1) Very very Good battery backup. I didn't expected this much. Almost full day backup with 50% volume. 2) Build quality 😀3) high bass.4) easy pairing 5) No disconnection problem. Cons:-1) Sound quality is ok ok. There is some sh-sh-shshsshsh radio like irritating voice. But i am quite Happy 😊 with the product. I will edit this review later. Thank You Flipkart and Delivery boy for fast delivery\n",

So...Coming to the sound, if you just love some BASS and heavy sounds this earphone will become your best buddy in no time. The volume on this is insane. I only use it at 20-30% max. It's very loud. So no complaints there.If you've used some premium earphone from brands like JBL, Sennheisser or even Samsung buds+ (even in the  Rs.5-10k range), you'll notice their sound, instruments separations etc., is more superior than this one from Boat. You can clearly make out the difference in the sounds produced, even the heavy BASS in BOAT feels too much artificial compared to them.So, if you're looking for pure music enjoyment, then go for some other earphones.BUT, if you just want that punchy bass your looking for and you're on a tight budget, then this is the one for you! Call quality is ok, in closed environment (room, office) it gets the job done. But in the open, not so much. There's a lot of disturbance and it picks up every noise in the open environment (traffic etc).Connectivity: No problems here. It pairs quite easily, and can go up to 22-27 feet with no drop in connection. Even when there's a wall the connection was solid.Built quality: Not much quality, considering price point, it's OK. Wires are very thin and the plastic looks cheap. But again for Rs. 899/- I'm fine with it.Conclusion: Sound quality: 7/10Bass : 9/10 (but it feels artificial when you compare to others like jbl, Sennheisser, Samsung)Built quality: 7/10Battery backup: 9/10 (easily can get 8-10hrs non stop)Call quality: 7/10Connectivity: 8.5/10\",\n",

       " \"Pros.1) bass is good 2) design is very good and build quality is also very nice3)ear fiting is really really good4)can connect to 2 devicesCons.1) connectivity is fast but audio lag is there.     A real noticeable gap that can make video different.2) connectivity is fast but sometimes showing connected but doesn't playing audio in earphone.3) treble is low and bass is high so sometimes in some song you will feel need of treble .Conclusion:-A good earphone with very sleek design and build.Nice fit in ear.can be a nice buy.......I bought it for 1099\",\n",
       " 'These earphones are really amazing and worth buying. .. only for those who loves playing song , movies or for gym purpose ... Those who wants to buy it for pubg .. i request u not to buy... Because sound comes after the gun shut.. sound delayed by some mini seconds.. not exactly when u fire..Otherwise it will be perfect 🤩And also thanks Flipkart',\n",
       " 'That earphones are amazing bass are very powerful and good sound quality........ love you boat...and love you flipkart.',\n",
       " 'DELIVERY IS GOOD IN BEFO ON TIME THANK U FLIPKART. PRODUCT IS AMAZING LOVE IT',\n",
       " 'This is amazing compact product  and sound quality is too good  when compared to boat 255f or audio curve this is flagship... Verry good Battery for 15min or charge it will be like 80% just go for it....!!!',\n",
       " \"Sound and bass is undoubtedly awesome in this price range.Battery performance is very good hence m using this from 1 week.Mic performance is fine while callingBuild quality is also good, it's light weight... The earplug cable could be a little better, I mean qualiry wise.Overall a very good product\",\n",

The range is not taht much of a improvement and the most annoying thing I experienced is that it gets disconnected very quick and most of time when I connect it with my laptop will only connect and voice and will take 2-3 tried to connect music.
